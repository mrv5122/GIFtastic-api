This website uses an API key from GIPHY to retrieve the top 10 trending GIFs of a selected category and displays them on the webpage along with their respective content rating. The project was created to familiarize oneself with API keys and how to dynamically incorporate fetched JSON information into an html page.
 
 # Motivation
 For this project, I chose to use car types as the topic for the website since I am fascinated with automobiles and driving technology. 

# Technologies used and why
<b> Built with: </b>
--Visual Studio Code
this code editing software allowed me to create an html with asset files including javascript and css
--GIPHY API
Free API key from https://developers.giphy.com/ was used to retreive GIF information.

# Features
--The website is designed with bootstrap and styled with a css stylesheet. The layout is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
--Clicking on a GIF will cause it to stop playing. Clicking it again will resume it.


# How To
1. click on any button to load the top 10 trending GIFs on GIPHY for that specific keyword.
2. type in any word or combination of words into the "add a car brand" form and press the "Submit" button to create a new button with your input. click on the new button to load the results.
3. when any button is clicked, the images on the screen are cleared and replaced with the new fetched image results.
