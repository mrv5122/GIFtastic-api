-this project uses an API key from GIPHY to retrieve the top 10 trending GIFs of a selected category and displays them on the webpage along with their respective content rating.
 -the project was created to familiarize oneself with API keys and how to dynamically incorporate fetched information into an html page.
 
 # Motivation
 For this project, I chose to use car types as the topic for the website since I am facinated with automobiles and driving technology. 

# Technologies used and why
<b> Built with</b>
- Visual Studio Code
this code editing software allowed me to create an html with asset files including javascript and css

# Features
the website is elegantly designed with bootstrap and styled with a css stylesheet. The layout is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

# How To
-click on any button to load the top 10 trending GIFs on GIPHY for that specific keyword.
-type in any word or combination of words into the "add a car brand" form and press the "Submit" button to create a new button with your input. click on the new button to load the results.
-when any button is clicked, the images on the screen are cleared and replaced with the new image results.
-clicking on a GIF will cause it to stop playing. clicking it again will resume it again.
